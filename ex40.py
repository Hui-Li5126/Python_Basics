#Modules, Classes, and Objects
#Modules are a python file with some functions or variables in it....
  #which you can import....
  #And access the functions or varibles of with the . (dot) operator.
  #think about a module as a specialized dictionary that can store Python code
  #so you can access it with the . operator.

#Class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and
  #place them inside a container so that you can access them
  #with the . (dot) operator.
